# arm64 Swift SDK overlays

Swift.org toolchains stopped shipping the Darwin SDK overlays, so the copies in this repository were x86_64-only (Swift 5.2.2). `build.sh` builds arm64 slices of six of them and merges them into the existing universal binaries. The x86_64 slices are unchanged. Four are built from the last open-source Swift sources; `os` and `XPC` were never open source, so they are written from Apple's public API documentation and the imported symbol names (no Apple code).

| Overlay | Sources | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `libswiftDarwin` | `swiftlang/swift` `release/6.1`, `stdlib/public/Platform` (`Darwin.swift` and `tgmath.swift` pre-expanded with gyb) | Needed at build time by the other overlays: the Clang importer maps C `Boolean` to `Darwin.DarwinBoolean` |
| `libswiftObjectiveC` | `release/5.4`, `stdlib/public/Darwin/ObjectiveC` | Unmodified |
| `libswiftCoreFoundation` | `release/5.4` `CoreFoundation.swift`, plus `CGFloat.swift` from the 5.4 CoreGraphics overlay | Newer SDKs moved `CGFloat` into this overlay; it's declared `@_originallyDefinedIn(module: "CoreGraphics", ...)` so its symbols keep their `CoreGraphics` mangling |
| `libswiftDispatch` | `release/5.4`, `stdlib/public/Darwin/Dispatch` | `Schedulers+DispatchQueue.swift` is dropped (it needs Combine). `Darling+NewerSDK.swift` and a designated `DispatchWorkItem.init(flags:block:)` add APIs from newer SDKs. `DarlingSerialExecutor.m` defines `OS_dispatch_queue_serial_executor` until Darling's libdispatch does |
| `libswiftos` | Clean-room (`os/os.swift`) | `Logger`, `os_log`, `os_signpost`, `OSSignpostID`, `OSSignposter`, `OSSignpostIntervalState`, `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`, and the `OSLog`/`OSLogType`/`OSSignpostType` extensions. `os_log` encodes arguments into the os_log buffer format and calls `_os_log_impl`. Signposts report as disabled: Darling's libsystem_trace signpost entry points abort |
| `libswiftXPC` | Clean-room (`XPC/XPC.swift`) | `XPCSession`, `XPCDictionary` (copy-on-write, with Bool/String/integer/object/dictionary/array subscripts), `XPCArray` and `XPCRichError`, on top of libxpc's C API |

## Coverage of what macOS 26 apps import

Measured against every binary in `/System/Applications` of a macOS 26.6.2 install:

- **ObjectiveC:** 14/14 symbols.
- **CoreFoundation:** 15/15, including the `$s12CoreGraphics7CGFloatV…` metadata and conformances.
- **os:** 44/44.
- **XPC:** 21/21.
- **Dispatch:** 94/104. The missing 10 are the Combine `Scheduler` conformance of `DispatchQueue` and its `SchedulerTimeType`/`SchedulerOptions` types (Combine is closed source).

## Building

See the header of `build.sh` for the required toolchain, resource directory, and Darling SDK/ld64/libSystem paths. The Darling SDK must include the Clang module maps for Darwin, ObjectiveC, Dispatch, os and CoreFoundation, and the `sys/cdefs.h` default-platform fix. Without that fix, arm64 code links against `$UNIX2003` symbol variants that don't exist.

## Tests

`tests/os_xpc.swift` covers `Logger`, `os_log` with arguments, signpost IDs and intervals, `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` across threads, `XPCDictionary`/`XPCArray` and `XPCSession`. `tests/objc_only.swift` and `tests/objc_cf.swift` cover an NSObject subclass with `@objc` methods and selectors, NSObject `Equatable`/`Hashable`, `autoreleasepool`, `ObjCBool`, CF types as `Hashable` (`_CFObject`), CFString round trips, and CGFloat. Build them for `arm64-apple-macosx26.0` against these overlays, link with Darling's ld64 (plus `-Xfrontend -disable-objc-attr-requires-foundation-module`, since there is no Foundation Swift overlay), and run them with `darling shell`.

`tests/utt_stubs.swift` checks that the stubs in `../libswiftUniformTypeIdentifiers.S` return valid values when called the way clients of the resilient UniformTypeIdentifiers module call them. Build and run it like the tests above, linking it against libswiftCore, libobjc and the built `libswiftUniformTypeIdentifiers.dylib`.
